        <h3>Farewell</h3>
        <p>Yellowcard went on their final world tour at the end of 2016, and I took advantage of that opportunity to capture the vengeance and determination expressed in the music of this stellar band.</p>
        <p>I feel this photograph portrays well the interaction between Ryan (the lead vocalist) and the crowd, as well as the energy felt by all.</p>

        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/05IbKDS.jpg" alt="Two boys fishing on a dock in a clear blue lake">
        <h3>Passion</h3>
        <p>These boys work hard to catch the biggest fish, and this photo helps the rest of us to understand why. The calmness of the water and a clear sky contrast the obvious focus and intensity in the boys’ posture. Fishing is exactly that, a dichotomy of peace and excitement, a roller coaster that keeps you coming back for more.</p>

        <h3>Thinner Air</h3>
        <p>Clarity. Freedom. As we climbed higher, our thoughts fell behind and our shoulders relaxed. The path opened into an easy descent, and we were happy to be alive.</p>
        <p>This picture expresses the peace we find in rugged imperfection. The soft light of the sunset bids farewell to the grass and paints long chasms in the mountains.</p>

        <h3>Night Grows Colder</h3>
        <p>As the night grew colder, our conversation waxed warmer. Night brings out some of the best experiences, and the beautiful transition seemed to forebode clear minds and close friendship.</p>
        <p>The juxtaposition of nature and city brings energy to this photo. The buildings are alive, and so is the water. They feed off of one another.</p>

        <h3>Under Your Feet</h3>
        <p>I found beauty as I attempted to capture the things we sometimes don’t notice. When I took this picture, my friend and I were on a hurry to get home. I saw this snail in passing, but I strongly felt that this was an opportunity for a good photo. I almost kept walking, but instead I let my friend keep going as I took my camera out of my bag for a couple shots. I almost missed taking this beautiful picture, but I am grateful that I gave time for the little things.</p>
